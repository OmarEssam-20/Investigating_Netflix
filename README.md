🚀 Netflix Data Analysis: Exploring 1990s Movie Trends 🎬

I just completed an exciting exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using Python and pandas to investigate movie trends from the 1990s on Netflix! Here's what I did:

🔍 Key Steps & Insights
1️⃣ Data Preparation

Filtered Netflix’s dataset to focus only on movies released between 1990–1999.

Cleaned and subsetted the data for analysis using pandas.

2️⃣ Visualizing Movie Durations

Created a histogram to analyze the distribution of movie durations in the 1990s.

Discovered that most movies clustered around a specific duration (likely 90–100 mins).

3️⃣ Counting Short Action Movies

Defined "short" movies as <90 minutes and counted them using efficient loops.

Identified how many of these were action films (a fun niche to explore further!).

🛠️ Tools Used
Python (pandas, matplotlib)

Data cleaning, filtering, and visualization

Conditional counting and aggregation

💡 Why This Matters
Understanding historical trends helps contextualize modern streaming habits—shorter movies might correlate with changing audience preferences!
